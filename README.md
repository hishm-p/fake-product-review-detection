# fake-product-review-prediction

The impact of reviews on any e-commerce site is of great importance, as it can be the basis for a buyerâ€™s decision to buy any product.
The scope and need of online markets and e-commerce
platforms are on the rise and many people buy products from these platforms.
The amount of feedback for products as a result are also present in detail for
users to analyze the product they are buying. This can work against the users
as well because users can sometimes bombard the review section with
extreme opinion comments which can work in favor or against the product.
Thus, there needs to be a tool that works in favor of identifying such reviews
because this can be done either by the merchant to increase the value of his
product or the user to degrade the ratings of that product.
The focus of this project is to identify features and build a machine learning
model to detect fake product reviews on online shopping websites
